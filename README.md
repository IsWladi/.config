# Dotfiles – Linux Configuration

This repository contains my personal Linux configuration files for a tiling window manager setup, development tools, and custom keyboard layout.

### Included directories

- **alacritty/** – Configuration for the Alacritty terminal emulator, including font and color scheme (dark with transparency).
- **i3/** – i3 window manager settings: keybindings, workspace rules, and app launching.
- **nvim/** – Neovim configuration for development, including plugins and UI tweaks.
- **picom/** – Compositor settings for i3 (shadows, blur, transparency).
- **polybar/** – Custom status bar replacement for i3 with modules (volume, workspaces, etc).
- **Qmk-Lily58-Dvorak/** – QMK firmware keymap for my Lily58 split keyboard with custom Dvorak layout.

### Notes

- **picom**, **alacritty**, and **i3** work together to provide a dark, semi-transparent desktop environment.
- The **QMK config** complements the i3 setup with key macros to control window behavior (e.g. moving workspaces).
